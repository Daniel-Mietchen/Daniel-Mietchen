# About

I am interested in how humanity can live sustainably, and I see the sharing of code, data, ideas and knowledge more generally as a key component to that.

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on making our human society more sustainable, and its subset called academia in particular.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Korean, Python, Wikibase, ShEx and [accordion](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Wiki_loves_Music_-_Hamburg-5701.jpg).
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on what matters or on things that make people think.
- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with any of the above.
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about opening up the research process, from ideas via methods to grant proposals, data management plans, results, collaborations or other outcomes of the process.
- âš¡ Fun fact: My favourite musical instrument is the [jaw harp](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Wiki_loves_Music_-_Hamburg-5811_(cropped).jpg).
- ðŸ˜„ Pronouns: Not me, us.
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: I try to keep my [ORCID profile](https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9488-1870) up to date.
