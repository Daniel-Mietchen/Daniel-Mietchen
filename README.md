# About

I am interested in how humanity can live sustainably, and I see the sharing of code, data, ideas and knowledge more generally as a key component to that.

- 🔭 I’m currently working on making our human society more sustainable, and its subset called academia in particular.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Korean and Python.
- 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on what matters or on things that make people think.
- 🤔 I’m looking for help with any of the above.
- 💬 Ask me about opening up the research process, from ideas via methods to grant proposals, data management plans and results of various stages of maturity.
