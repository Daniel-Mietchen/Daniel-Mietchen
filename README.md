# About

I am interested in how humanity can live sustainably, and I see the sharing of code, data, ideas and knowledge more generally as a key component to that.

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on making our human society more sustainable, and its subset called academia in particular.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Korean, Python, Wikibase and ShEx.
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on what matters or on things that make people think.
- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with any of the above.
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about opening up the research process, from ideas via methods to grant proposals, data management plans and results or other outcomes of the process.
